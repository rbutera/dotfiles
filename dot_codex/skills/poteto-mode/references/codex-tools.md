# Codex tool mapping for pstack

pstack skills are written in Claude Code tool language (the `Skill` tool, the `Agent` tool, `AskUserQuestion`, model slugs like `claude-opus-4-8`). On Codex the skills are the same files; only the tool names resolve differently. Read this when a pstack skill names a Claude tool, a Claude built-in skill, or a `claude-*` model.

## Tool actions

| pstack / Claude action | Codex equivalent |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Read a file | `shell` (`cat`, `head`, `tail`) |
| Create / edit / delete a file | `apply_patch` |
| Run a shell command | `shell` |
| Search file contents / find files | `shell` (`rg`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) |
| Fetch a URL | `shell` with `curl` / `wget` |
| Search the web | `web_search` |
| Invoke a skill (the `Skill` tool, `/command`) | Skills load natively. Follow the instructions presented. |
| Dispatch a subagent (the `Agent`/`Task` tool) | `spawn_agent` |
| Dispatch N parallel subagents in one turn | N `spawn_agent` calls in one response |
| Wait for a subagent result | `wait_agent` |
| Free a finished subagent slot | `close_agent` |
| Track tasks (the todolist / `TodoWrite`) | `update_plan` |
| Ask the human a fixed-choice question (`AskUserQuestion`) | Ask in plain text and let the user answer. Codex has no structured-choice tool. |

Subagent dispatch needs `multi_agent` enabled. Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

Without it, `spawn_agent` is unavailable and the fan-out skills (`interrogate`, `why`, `how`, `arena`, `reflect`) degrade to a single sequential pass.

## Subagent policy

poteto-mode's Subagents section sets Claude-specific defaults (`subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`, `run_in_background: true`). On Codex:

- There is no `poteto-agent` subagent type. Route an ad-hoc subagent through poteto-mode's style by dispatching a `spawn_agent` whose instructions tell it to read the `poteto-mode` skill in full first.
- `spawn_agent` calls already run concurrently with your turn, so `run_in_background: true` has no separate flag. Issue the dispatch and continue.
- Keep the rest of the policy unchanged. Pass file pointers not inlined context, give each worker its own worktree or branch when they write, review every subagent's diff yourself.

## Model names

Skills name Claude defaults (`claude-opus-4-8` for code/prose/judgment; a four-model quad for diverse-model panels, enumerated in the panel skills). These slugs do not resolve on Codex. Substitute your configured Codex models:

- Single-model roles: your primary Codex model (for example `gpt-5.6-sol`).
- Diverse-model panels (`arena`, `architect`, `interrogate`, `how` critics, `reflect`): the adversarial signal comes from model diversity, so use the distinct Codex models available to you. A good default quad on ChatGPT is `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.6-luna`. If only one model family is reachable, vary reasoning effort and note in the verdict that diversity was reduced.

`/setup-pstack` writes the configured model list. On Codex, set it to your Codex model slugs.

## Claude built-in skills pstack references

Some triggers name skills that ship with Claude Code, not pstack. They do not exist on Codex. Substitute the behavior:

| Claude built-in named in pstack | On Codex |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| `run` (drive a CLI/TUI to see a change work) | Run the app yourself via `shell` and observe the real output. |
| `verify` (drive a UI to confirm a fix) | Drive the UI with whatever automation you have, or hand the user a concrete manual check. Do not claim done without observing the artifact. |
| `plugin-dev:skill-development` (Claude's SKILL.md authoring guidance) | Follow your platform's skill-authoring guidance; the `writing-skills` skill if present. Keep `name` + `description` frontmatter and progressive disclosure. |
| `loop` (recurring/self-paced re-invocation, used by `babysit`) | Codex has no `loop` skill. Re-run the step yourself on a cadence, or use a Codex scheduled task if available. |

## Instructions file

Where a pstack skill says "your instructions file", on Codex that is `AGENTS.md` (project root, plus `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` global). On Claude Code it is `CLAUDE.md`.
