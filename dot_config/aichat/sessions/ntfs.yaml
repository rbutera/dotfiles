    for the last two entries, i'm thinking of either switching to ufsd or.. if that's too complicated, just plain old ntfs-3g. what do you advise? and if i do the latter, can i keep the options the same or are some of them not relevant/compatible with ntfs-3g?

    Your current setup is using the ntfs3 driver, which is the newer in-kernel NTFS driver introduced in Linux kernel 5.15. It's generally faster and more feature-rich than the older ntfs-3g driver.

    However, if you're experiencing issues with ntfs3 or prefer to use ntfs-3g for any reason, you can certainly switch. Here's what you need to know:

    1. UFSD (Paragon's NTFS driver):
       This is a proprietary driver and might require purchasing a license. It's known for good performance but isn't as widely used in the Linux community.

    2. NTFS-3g:
       This is the older, FUSE-based NTFS driver. It's stable and widely used but may have lower performance compared to ntfs3.

    If you decide to switch to ntfs-3g, you can modify your fstab entries like this:

    ```
    UUID=2462016462013BD4 /c ntfs-3g defaults,nofail,noatime,rw,auto,users,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
    UUID=0C9E41649E414802 /x ntfs-3g defaults,nofail,noatime,rw,auto,users,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
    ```

    Changes:
    1. Changed "ntfs3" to "ntfs-3g"
    2. Removed "x-systemd.device-timeout=30" as it's not typically used with ntfs-3g
    3. Changed the last field from 2 to 0, as NTFS partitions typically don't need a filesystem check

    Most of the options you're using are compatible with ntfs-3g. The "uid" and "gid" options are particularly useful for setting ownership of files and directories.

    Keep in mind that switching to ntfs-3g might result in slower performance compared to ntfs3. Unless you're experiencing specific issues with ntfs3, it might be better to stick with it.

    If you do decide to switch, make sure to install the ntfs-3g package if it's not already installed on your system:

    ```
    sudo apt install ntfs-3g   # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
    sudo dnf install ntfs-3g   # For Fedora/RHEL-based systems
    ```

    After making changes to fstab, remember to test the new configuration with `sudo mount -a` before rebooting to ensure there are no issues.
