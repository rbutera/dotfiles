  content: i can't afford beekeeper ultimate but i need to be able to access our aws postgres server which is only accessible through our bastion (so ssh tunneling). can you help me set up some scripts that will create the necessary tunnel and expose port 5432 to port 5433 on my system so that I can connect using postgres://user:password@localhost:5433/database_name (or whatever the connection string format is supposed to be). i would like to be able to switch off the tunnel too where possible
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    Sure, we can set up some scripts to handle this for you. We'll create two scripts: one to start the tunnel and another to stop it. Here's how we'll do it:

    1. Create a start tunnel script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # start_tunnel.sh

    SSH_KEY="path/to/your/ssh/key"
    BASTION_USER="your_bastion_username"
    BASTION_HOST="your_bastion_host"
    DB_HOST="your_db_host"
    DB_PORT="5432"
    LOCAL_PORT="5433"

    ssh -i $SSH_KEY -N -L $LOCAL_PORT:$DB_HOST:$DB_PORT $BASTION_USER@$BASTION_HOST &
    echo $! > /tmp/postgres_tunnel.pid
    echo "Tunnel started. PID: $(cat /tmp/postgres_tunnel.pid)"
    ```

    2. Create a stop tunnel script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # stop_tunnel.sh

    if [ -f /tmp/postgres_tunnel.pid ]; then
        PID=$(cat /tmp/postgres_tunnel.pid)
        kill $PID
        rm /tmp/postgres_tunnel.pid
        echo "Tunnel stopped. PID: $PID"
    else
        echo "No tunnel found."
    fi
    ```

    3. Make both scripts executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x start_tunnel.sh stop_tunnel.sh
    ```

    4. To use these scripts:

    To start the tunnel:
    ```bash
    ./start_tunnel.sh
    ```

    To stop the tunnel:
    ```bash
    ./stop_tunnel.sh
    ```

    5. Connect to your database using:
    ```
    postgres://user:password@localhost:5433/database_name
    ```

    Remember to replace the placeholders in the `start_tunnel.sh` script with your actual values:
    - `path/to/your/ssh/key`
    - `your_bastion_username`
    - `your_bastion_host`
    - `your_db_host`

    These scripts should give you the functionality you need without relying on Beekeeper Ultimate.

Save it as `bastion_tunnel` (without any file extension).\n\n2. Make it executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x bastion_tunnel\n   ```\n\n3. Replace the placeholders at the top of the script with your actual values:\n   - `path/to/your/ssh/key`\n   - `your_bastion_username`\n   - `your_bastion_host`\n   - `your_db_host`\n\n4. To start the tunnel:\n   ```bash\n   ./bastion_tunnel up\n   ```\n\n5. To stop the tunnel:\n   ```bash\n   ./bastion_tunnel down\n   ```\n\nNow you have a single script that can handle both creating and destroying the tunnel. Remember to place this script somewhere in your PATH if you want to run it from any directory without specifying the full path."

  content: how do i install aws-cli v2 in arch?
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    To install AWS CLI v2 on Arch Linux, we can use the Arch User Repository (AUR). Here's how we can do it:

    1. First, make sure we have an AUR helper installed. The most popular one is `yay`. If we don't have it, we can install it:

       ```bash
       sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
       git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
       cd yay
       makepkg -si
       ```

    2. Once we have `yay` installed, we can use it to install AWS CLI v2:

       ```bash
       yay -S aws-cli-v2-bin
       ```

       This package provides a pre-built binary of AWS CLI v2.

    3. If prompted, review the package details and confirm the installation.

    4. After installation, we can verify it's working by checking the version:

       ```bash
       aws --version
       ```

    This should install AWS CLI v2 on our Arch system. Remember, AUR packages are maintained by the community, so always review the package before installing.

    If we prefer to avoid AUR helpers, we can manually install from the AUR:

    ```bash
    git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aws-cli-v2-bin.git
    cd aws-cli-v2-bin
    makepkg -si
    ```

    This method requires more manual steps but achieves the same result.

  content: i have a weird problem. sometimes randomly i can't type capital t. like i can press lowercase t fine and i can press shift fine, i think its a software issue but i can't figure out what's hijacked it
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    This is indeed a strange issue. Let's try to troubleshoot it systematically:

    1. Keyboard layout:
       Check if your keyboard layout has accidentally changed:
       ```
       setxkbmap -query
       ```
       Ensure it's set to your correct layout (e.g., "us" for US English).

    2. Key bindings:
       Use `xev` to check if the 'T' key is being recognized:
       ```
       xev
       ```
       Press Shift+T and see if it's detected correctly.

    3. Input method:
       Check if an input method is interfering. Try disabling it temporarily:
       ```
       im-config -n none
       ```
       Then log out and back in.

    4. Conflicting software:
       - Check for any recently installed software that might be capturing keystrokes.
       - Temporarily disable any keyboard customization tools or macro software.

    5. Wayland-specific issues:
       Since you're using Wayland, check if the issue persists in X11. You can temporarily switch to X11 to test.

    6. Hyprland config:
       Review your Hyprland configuration for any bindings that might be capturing Shift+T.

    7. System logs:
       Check system logs for any relevant errors:
       ```
       journalctl -b | grep -i keyboard
       ```

    8. Update and reboot:
       Ensure your system is fully updated, then reboot:
       ```
       paru -Syu
       reboot
       ```

    If none of these solve the issue, we might need to dig deeper into system processes or consider if it's a hardware problem. Let me know the results of these steps, and we can proceed from there.
- role: user
  content: wev
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    Ah, good catch. I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're right to point out "wev" instead of "xev". Since you're using Wayland with Hyprland, "xev" wouldn't be the right tool. Let's use "wev" to diagnose the issue:

    1. First, make sure "wev" is installed. If it's not, install it:

       ```bash
       paru -S wev
       ```

    2. Run wev:

       ```bash
       wev
       ```

    3. Press Shift+T and observe the output. You should see something like this for a normal Shift+T press:

       ```
       [timestamp] keyboard key: press   key 28 (T)
       [timestamp] keyboard key: release key 28 (T)
       ```

    This will help us determine if the key press is being recognized correctly at the Wayland level.

    If "wev" shows that Shift+T is being recognized correctly, the issue is likely with a higher-level software or configuration. In this case, let's try the following:

    1. Check Hyprland config:
       Review your Hyprland configuration file (usually at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`) for any bindings that might be capturing Shift+T.

    2. Input method:
       If you're using an input method like fcitx or ibus, try disabling it temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.

    3. Keyboard layout:
       Check your keyboard layout:
       ```bash
       hyprctl devices
       ```
       Look for the keyboard section and ensure the layout is correct.

    4. System logs:
       Check for any relevant errors:
       ```bash
       journalctl -b | grep -i keyboard
       ```

    5. Update and reboot:
       Ensure your system is fully updated, then reboot:
       ```bash
       paru -Syu
       reboot
       ```

    If the issue persists after these steps, let me know the results, especially what you see in "wev" when pressing Shift+T. We may need to investigate further based on that information.

    when i run aws ssm get-parameters --name 'x' --with-decrption i get output like this

    {
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "/PROD/ALL/LEXSTEP_DB_USER",
          "Type": "SecureString",
          "Value": "postgres",
          "Version": 1,

          "DataType": "text"
        }
      ],
      "InvalidParameters": []
    }

    how can i use jq to get the Value?
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    To extract the "Value" from the AWS SSM output using jq, we can use the following command:

    ```bash
    aws ssm get-parameters --name 'x' --with-decryption | jq -r '.Parameters[0].Value'
    ```

    Let's break down what this does:

    1. `.Parameters[0]` selects the first (and in this case, only) item in the "Parameters" array.
    2. `.Value` selects the "Value" field from that item.
    3. The `-r` option in jq outputs raw strings without quotes.

    If you want to be more specific or if there might be multiple parameters, you could also filter by the exact parameter name:

    ```bash
    aws ssm get-parameters --name 'x' --with-decryption | jq -r '.Parameters[] | select(.Name == "/PROD/ALL/LEXSTEP_DB_USER") | .Value'
    ```

    This will work even if there are multiple parameters in the output, as long as one matches the exact name we're looking for.

    Remember to replace 'x' in the AWS command with the actual parameter name you're querying.
- role: user
  content: can i remove the surrounding double quotes? i'd like to make a script called get_ssm_params that lets me type in the full name of an ssm param and it returns me the raw value so i can copy paste it
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    Absolutely! We can create a script that does exactly that. Here's a script that will take the SSM parameter name as an argument and return the raw value without quotes:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # File: get_ssm_param

    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <ssm-parameter-name>"
        exit 1
    fi

    param_name="$1"

    value=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "$param_name" --with-decryption --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo -n "$value"
    else
        echo "Error retrieving parameter $param_name" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

    Here's how to set it up:

    1. Create the script:
       ```bash
       nvim get_ssm_param
       ```

    2. Paste the above content into the file and save it.

    3. Make the script executable:
       ```bash
       chmod +x get_ssm_param
       ```

    4. Move the script to a directory in your PATH, for example:
       ```bash
       sudo mv get_ssm_param /usr/local/bin/
       ```

    Now you can use it like this:

    ```bash
    get_ssm_param /PROD/ALL/LEXSTEP_DB_USER
    ```

    This will output the raw value without any quotes, ready for copying and pasting.

    The script does the following:
    - It checks if a parameter name was provided.
    - It uses `aws ssm get-parameter` with the `--query` option to extract just the Value.
    - The `--output text` option ensures the output is not in JSON format and doesn't have quotes.
    - It uses `echo -n` to output the value without a newline at the end.
    - If there's an error, it will display an error message.

    This script should give you exactly what you need - a simple way to get the raw value of an SSM parameter for easy copying and pasting.

  content: chezmoi apply is reallllyyyyyy slow on my system. are there any known fixes
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    Slow `chezmoi apply` operations can be frustrating. Let's go through some potential fixes and optimizations:

    1. Use source-path format:
       Add `sourcePathFormat = "shorter"` to your `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` file. This can significantly speed up operations on systems with long home directory paths.

    2. Exclude large directories:
       If you have large directories that don't change often, consider excluding them:
       ```toml
       [diff]
         exclude = ["~/big_directory"]
       ```

    3. Use .chezmoiignore:
       Create a `.chezmoiignore` file in your source directory to exclude files/directories that don't need management.

    4. Update chezmoi:
       Ensure you're running the latest version:
       ```bash
       paru -S chezmoi
       ```

    5. Use persistent state:
       Add `persistent = true` to your `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` file. This caches state between runs.

    6. Optimize templates:
       If you're using complex templates, simplify them if possible.

    7. Check system resources:
       Run `htop` while applying to see if it's a system resource issue.

    8. Use dry run first:
       Run `chezmoi apply -n` first to cache computations.

    9. Verbose output:
       Run `chezmoi apply -v` to see where it's spending time.

    10. Consider sparse checkouts:
        If your source state is in a large Git repo, use sparse checkouts.

    11. Use `chezmoi apply --exclude=scripts`:
        This skips running scripts, which can be time-consuming.

    If these don't help, we might need to profile chezmoi to find the bottleneck. Let me know if you need help with that or if any of these suggestions improve the situation.

  content: how do i configure npm/pnpm to not tag / commit when i run npm version, i just want to bump the version number
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    To configure npm/pnpm to not tag or commit when running `npm version`, we can use the following approaches:

    For npm:

    1. Use command-line flags:
       ```bash
       npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
       ```
       This will bump the version without creating a git tag or commit.

    2. Configure in package.json:
       Add this to your package.json:
       ```json
       "scripts": {
         "version": "npm version --no-git-tag-version"
       }
       ```
       Then run `npm run version patch` (or minor/major as needed).

    3. Set npm config:
       ```bash
       npm config set git-tag-version false
       ```
       This sets it globally for all projects.

    For pnpm:

    1. Use command-line flags:
       ```bash
       pnpm version patch --no-git-tag-version
       ```

    2. Configure in .npmrc:
       Create or edit .npmrc in your project root:
       ```
       git-tag-version=false
       ```

    3. Set pnpm config:
       ```bash
       pnpm config set git-tag-version false
       ```
       This sets it globally for all projects using pnpm.

    These methods will bump the version number in package.json without creating a git tag or commit. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.
- role: user
  content: npm config set git-tag-version false
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    Great choice! We've set npm to not create git tags when versioning. Here's what this does:

    1. It applies globally to all your npm projects.
    2. When you run `npm version`, it will only update the version in `package.json`.
    3. It won't create a git tag or commit.

    To use it:

    1. Simply run `npm version patch` (or `minor` or `major`) as usual.
    2. The version in `package.json` will be bumped.
    3. No git operations will occur.

    If you ever need to revert this:

    ```bash
    npm config delete git-tag-version
    ```

    Or to temporarily override for a single command:

    ```bash
    npm version patch --git-tag-version
    ```

    Remember, this setting doesn't affect `pnpm`. If you use both, you might want to set a similar config for `pnpm` or use the command-line flag when needed.

    To set this globally for pnpm as well, we can use the following command:

    ```bash
    pnpm config set git-tag-version false -g
    ```

    This command does the following:

    1. Sets the `git-tag-version` configuration to `false` for pnpm.
    2. The `-g` flag makes this a global setting, applying to all your pnpm projects.

    After running this command, pnpm will not create git tags or commits when you run `pnpm version`.

    To verify the setting:

    ```bash
    pnpm config get git-tag-version
    ```

    This should output `false`.

    If you ever need to revert this setting:

    ```bash
    pnpm config delete git-tag-version -g
    ```

    Now, both npm and pnpm will bump versions without creating git tags or commits by default. You can still override this behavior for individual commands by using the `--git-tag-version` flag if needed.

    Remember, these global settings affect all your projects. If you need different behavior for specific projects, consider using local `.npmrc` or `.pnpmrc` files instead.
