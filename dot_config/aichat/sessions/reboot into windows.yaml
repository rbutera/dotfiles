    Yes, you can issue a command in your Linux terminal to tell rEFInd to reboot into Windows. However, the exact method depends on how your system is set up and which version of rEFInd you're using.

    Here are a few approaches you can try:

    1. If you're using a recent version of rEFInd (0.11.0 or later), you can use the `refind-next-boot` command:

    ```
    sudo refind-next-boot Windows
    sudo reboot
    ```

    This sets Windows as the next boot option and then reboots the system.

    2. If that doesn't work, you can try modifying the EFI boot order directly:

    ```
    sudo efibootmgr --bootnext $(efibootmgr | grep Windows | sed 's/.*Boot\([0-9a-f]\{4\}\).*/\1/')
    sudo reboot
    ```

    This command finds the EFI entry for Windows, sets it as the next boot option, and then reboots.

    3. If your system uses GRUB as the bootloader and GRUB chainloads rEFInd, you might need to use GRUB commands instead:

    ```
    sudo grub-reboot "Windows Boot Manager"
    sudo reboot
    ```

    This tells GRUB to boot into Windows on the next reboot.

    4. If none of these work, you might need to create a custom script that modifies rEFInd's configuration file to set Windows as the default boot option, then reboots the system.

    Remember to replace "Windows" or "Windows Boot Manager" with the exact name of your Windows boot entry if it's different on your system.

    Also, note that these commands require sudo privileges, so you'll need to enter your password.

    If you're not sure which method to use, or if you're concerned about making changes to your boot configuration, it's always safer to reboot and select Windows manually from the rEFInd menu.
