    Yes, it is possible to compress a PDF document from the terminal. There are several command-line tools you can use for this purpose. Here are a few options:

    1. Ghostscript:
    Ghostscript is a powerful tool for manipulating PDF files. You can use it to compress PDFs with this command:

    ```
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf
    ```

    You can adjust the compression level by changing `/ebook` to `/screen` (lowest quality, smallest size) or `/printer` (higher quality, larger size).

    2. qpdf:
    qpdf is another useful tool for PDF manipulation:

    ```
    qpdf --stream-data=compress --object-streams=generate input.pdf output.pdf
    ```

    3. ps2pdf (part of Ghostscript):
    This is a simpler way to use Ghostscript:

    ```
    ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook input.pdf output.pdf
    ```

    4. pdfsizeopt:
    This is a specialized tool for PDF compression:

    ```
    pdfsizeopt input.pdf output.pdf
    ```

    5. img2pdf:
    If your PDF consists mainly of images, you can use img2pdf to create a new, potentially smaller PDF:

    ```
    img2pdf --output output.pdf input.pdf
    ```

    Before using any of these tools, you may need to install them using your system's package manager (e.g., apt-get for Ubuntu, brew for macOS).

    Remember that the effectiveness of compression depends on the content of your PDF. Documents with many images or complex graphics may compress more than those with mostly text.
